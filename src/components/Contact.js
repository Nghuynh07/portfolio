              I am currently looking for an opportunity as a front-end
              developer. I have 10 years work experience in professional
              pharmacy setting and I believe a lot of it can be carried over
              into programming as well. I also graduated with BA in
              Interdisciplinary Visual Art in 2012 which also helps me becoming
              a better front-end developer.
