          Hello There! I am a front-end developer. I remember looking at
          websites and wondering how these beautiful pages were created. Over
          the years, my curiosity grew and in March, 2021 I decided to slowly
          transition my career into programming after 10 years in pharmacy
          setting. It wasn't easy, but it was a start. I immediately enrolled in
          coding boot camp and started my programming journey. I fell in love
          with front-end development during the boot camp.
