            I remember looking at websites and wondering how these beautiful
            pages were created. Over the years, my curiosity grew and in March,
            2021 I decided to slowly transition my career into programming after
            10 years of pharmacy setting. It wasn't easy, but it was a start. I
            immediately enrolled in coding boot camp and started my programming
            journey. I fell in love with front-end development during boot camp
            and have been honing my skills as front-end developer ever since.
