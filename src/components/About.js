          I remember looking at websites and wondering how these beautiful pages
          were created. Over the years, my curiosity grew and in March, 2021 I
          decided to slowly transition my career into programming after 10 years
          in pharmacy setting. It wasn't easy, but it was a start. I immediately
          enrolled in coding boot camp and started my programming journey. I
          fell in love with front-end development during the boot camp.
